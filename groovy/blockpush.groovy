/**
 * Sample Gitblit Pre-Receive Hook: blockpush
 * 
 * This script could and perhaps should be further developed to provide
 * a full repository-branch permissions system similar to gitolite or gitosis.
 *
 * The Pre-Receive hook is executed after an incoming push has been parsed,
 * validated, and objects have been written but BEFORE the refs are updated.
 * This is the appropriate point to block a push for some reason.
 *
 * This script is only executed when pushing to *Gitblit*, not to other Git
 * tooling you may be using.
 * 
 * If this script is specified in *groovy.preReceiveScripts* of gitblit.properties
 * or web.xml then it will be executed by any repository when it receives a
 * push.  If you choose to share your script then you may have to consider
 * tailoring control-flow based on repository access restrictions.
 * 
 * Scripts may also be specified per-repository in the repository settings page.
 * Shared scripts will be excluded from this list of available scripts.
 *
 * This script is dynamically reloaded and it is executed within it's own
 * exception handler so it will not crash another script nor crash Gitblit.
 * 
 * If you want this hook script to fail and abort all subsequent scripts in the
 * chain, "return false" at the appropriate failure points.
 *
