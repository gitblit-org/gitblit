### Current Release

**%VERSION%** ([go](http://code.google.com/p/gitblit/downloads/detail?name=%GO%) | [war](http://code.google.com/p/gitblit/downloads/detail?name=%WAR%) | [express](http://code.google.com/p/gitblit/downloads/detail?name=%EXPRESS%) | [fedclient](http://code.google.com/p/gitblit/downloads/detail?name=%FEDCLIENT%) | [manager](http://code.google.com/p/gitblit/downloads/detail?name=%MANAGER%) | [api](http://code.google.com/p/gitblit/downloads/detail?name=%API%)) based on [%JGIT%][jgit] &nbsp; *released %BUILDDATE%*

#### security

- Fixed session fixation vulnerability where the session identifier was not reset during the login process (issue 62)

#### changes

- Reject pushes to a repository with a working copy (i.e. non-bare repository) (issue-49)
- Changed default web.datetimestampLongFormat from *EEEE, MMMM d, yyyy h:mm a z* to *EEEE, MMMM d, yyyy HH:mm Z* (issue 50)
- Expanded commit age coloring from 2 days to 30 days (issue 57)

#### additions

- Added optional Lucene branch indexing (issue 16)  
    **New:** *web.allowLuceneIndexing = true*  
    **New:** *web.luceneIgnoreExtensions = 7z arc arj bin bmp dll doc docx exe gif gz jar jpg lib lzh odg odf odt pdf ppt png so swf xcf xls xlsx zip*  
Repository branches may be optionally indexed by Lucene for improved searching.  To use this feature you must specify which branches to index within the *Edit Repository* page; _no repositories are automatically indexed_.  Gitblit will build or incrementally update enrolled repositories on a 2 minute cycle. (i.e you will have to wait 2-3 minutes after respecifying indexed branches or pushing new commits before Gitblit will build/update the repository's Lucene index.)  
If a repository has Lucene-indexed branches the *search* form on the repository pages will redirect to the root-level Lucene search page and only the content of those branches can be searched.  
If the repository does not specify any indexed branches then repository commit-traversal search is used.  
**Note:** Initial indexing of an existing repository can be memory-exhaustive. Be sure to provide your Gitblit server adequate heap space to index your repositories (e.g. -Xmx1024M).
- Allow specifying timezone to use for Gitblit which is independent of both the JVM and the system timezone (issue 54)  
    **New:** *web.timezone =*  
- Added a built-in AJP connector for integrating Gitblit GO into an Apache mod_proxy setup (issue 59)  
    **New:** *server.ajpPort = 0*  
    **New:** *server.ajpBindInterface = localhost*
- On the Repositories page show a bang *!* character in the color swatch of a repository with a working copy (issue 49)  
Push requests to these repositories will be rejected.
- On all non-bare Repository pages show *WORKING COPY* in the upper right corner (issue 49)
- New setting to prevent display/serving non-bare repositories  
    **New:** *git.onlyAccessBareRepositories = false*
- Added *protect-refs.groovy* (Github/plm) 
- Allow setting default branch (relinking HEAD) to a branch or a tag (Github/plm)
- Added Ubuntu service init script (issue 72)
- Added partial Japanese translation (Github/zakki)

#### fixes 

- Ensure that Welcome message is parsed using UTF-8 encoding (issue 74) 
- Activity page chart layout broken by Google (issue 73)
- Uppercase repositories not selectable in edit palettes (issue 71)
- Not all git notes were properly displayed on the commit page (issue 70)
- Activity page now displays all local branches (issue 65)

- Fixed timezone bugs on the activity page (issue 54)
- Prevent add/edit team with no selected repositories (issue 56) 
- Disallow browser autocomplete on add/edit user/team/repository pages

#### additions

- Platform-independent, Groovy push hook script mechanism.  
Hook scripts can be set per-repository, per-team, or globally for all repositories.  
    **New:** *groovy.scriptsFolder = groovy*  
    **New:** *groovy.preReceiveScripts =*  
    **New:** *groovy.postReceiveScripts =*
- *sendmail.groovy* for optional email notifications on push.  
You must properly configure your SMTP server settings in `gitblit.properties` or `web.xml` to use *sendmail.groovy*.
- New global key for mailing lists.  This is used in conjunction with the *sendmail.groovy* hook script.  All repositories that use the *sendmail.groovy* script will include these addresses in the notification process.  Please see the Setup page for more details about configuring sendmail.  
    **New:** *mail.mailingLists =*
- *com.gitblit.GitblitUserService*.  This is a wrapper object for the built-in user service implementations.  For those wanting to only implement custom authentication it is recommended to subclass GitblitUserService and override the appropriate methods.  Going forward, this will help insulate custom authentication from new IUserService API and/or changes in model classes.
- New default user service implementation: *com.gitblit.ConfigUserService* (`users.conf`)  
This user service implementation allows for serialization and deserialization of more sophisticated Gitblit User objects without requiring the encoding trickery now present in FileUserService (users.properties).  This will open the door for more advanced Gitblit features.  
For those upgrading from an earlier Gitblit version, a `users.conf` file will automatically be created for you from your existing `users.properties` file on your first launch of Gitblit <u>however</u> you will have to manually set *realm.userService=users.conf* to switch to the new user service.  
The original `users.properties` file and it's corresponding implementation are **deprecated**.  
    **New:** *realm.userService = users.conf*
- Teams for specifying user-repository access in bulk.  Teams may also specify mailing lists addresses and pre- & post- receive hook scripts.
- Gravatar integration  
    **New:** *web.allowGravatar = true*   
- Activity page for aggregated repository activity.  This is a timeline of commit activity over the last N days for one or more repositories.  
   **New:** *web.activityDuration = 14*  
   **New:** *web.timeFormat = HH:mm*  
   **New:** *web.datestampLongFormat = EEEE, MMMM d, yyyy*  
- *Filters* menu for the Repositories page and Activity page.  You can filter by federation set, team, and simple custom regular expressions.  Custom expressions can be stored in `gitblit.properties` or `web.xml` or directly defined in your url (issue 27)  
   **New:** *web.customFilters=*
- Flash-based 1-step *copy to clipboard* of the primary repository url based on Clippy  
   **New:** *web.allowFlashCopyToClipboard = true*
- JavaScript-based 3-step (click, ctrl+c, enter) *copy to clipboard* of the primary repository url in the event that you do not want to use Flash on your installation
- Empty repositories now link to an *empty repository* page which gives some direction to the user for the next step in using Gitblit.  This page displays the primary push/clone url of the repository and gives sample syntax for the git command-line client. (issue 31)
- Repositories with a *gh-pages* branch will now have a *pages* link which will serve the content of this branch.  All resource requests are against the repository, Gitblit does not checkout/export this branch to a temporary filesystem.  Jekyll templating is not supported.
- Gitblit Express bundle to get started running Gitblit on RedHat's OpenShift cloud <span class="label label-warning">BETA</span>

#### changes

- Dropped display of trailing .git from repository names
- Gitblit GO is now monolithic like the WAR build. (issue 30)  
This change helps adoption of GO in environments without an internet connection or with a restricted connection.
- Unit testing framework has been migrated to JUnit4 syntax and the test suite has been redesigned to run all unit tests, including rpc, federation, and git push/clone tests

#### fixes

- Several a bugs in FileUserService related to cleaning up old repository permissions on a rename or delete
- Renaming a repository into a new subfolder failed (issue 33)

#### dependency changes

- updated to JGit 1.2.0
- added Groovy 1.8.5 
- added Clippy (bundled)
