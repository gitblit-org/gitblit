## Upgrading Gitblit WAR (1.2.1+)
1. Make sure your `WEB-INF/web.xml` *baseFolder* context parameter is not `${contextFolder}/WEB-INF/data`!<br/>
If it is, move your `WEB-INF/data` folder to a location writeable by your servlet container.
2. Deploy new WAR
3. Edit the new WAR's `WEB-INF/web.xml` file and set the *baseFolder* context parameter to your external baseFolder.
4. Review and optionally apply any new settings as indicated in the [release log](releases.html) to `${baseFolder}/gitblit.properties`. 
 

## Upgrading Gitblit WAR (pre-1.2.1)

1. Create a `data` as outlined in step 1 of *Upgrading Gitblit GO (pre-1.2.1)*
2. Copy your existing web.xml to your data folder
3. Deploy new WAR
4. Copy the new WAR's `WEB-INF/data/gitblit.properties` file to your data folder
5. Manually apply any changes you made to your original web.xml file to the gitblit.properties file you copied to your data folder
6. Edit the new WAR's `WEB-INF/web.xml` file and set the *baseFolder* context parameter to your external baseFolder.
