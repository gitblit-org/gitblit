This is easier with the 1.6 release since management links have been moved internal to the repository.\n\nTake a look at *FilterableRepositoryList*.  My plan was to follow that design: Wicket+FreeMarker+Angular.\n\nThe basic idea is to inject a JSON array of the minimum viable repo information into the Wicket+FreeMarker generated page and then render the repo list client-side with Angular.  Once you have that working, adding an Angular filter is easy.  There are also nice Angular grids that support grouping rows and collapse/expand.","id":"d72e6d7b05340afa09ab8436e512e003469bc66f"}},{"date":"2014-07-02T08:49:48Z","author":"alex","comment":{"text":"Ok cheers, I\u0027ll start working on this issue.","id":"8feb06cc961011a80933309972e34a58574ca760"}},{"date":"2014-07-03T22:31:42Z","author":"james","fields":{"responsible":"alex"}}]
