This is easier with the 1.6 release since management links have been moved internal to the repository.\n\nTake a look at *FilterableRepositoryList*.  My plan was to follow that design: Wicket+FreeMarker+Angular.\n\nThe basic idea is to inject a JSON array of the minimum viable repo information into the Wicket+FreeMarker generated page and then render the repo list client-side with Angular.  Once you have that working, adding an Angular filter is easy.  There are also nice Angular grids that support grouping rows and collapse/expand.","id":"d72e6d7b05340afa09ab8436e512e003469bc66f"}},{"date":"2014-07-02T08:49:48Z","author":"alex","comment":{"text":"Ok cheers, I\u0027ll start working on this issue.","id":"8feb06cc961011a80933309972e34a58574ca760"}},{"date":"2014-07-03T22:31:42Z","author":"james","fields":{"responsible":"alex"}},{"date":"2014-07-28T12:50:25Z","author":"alex","comment":{"text":"Hi,\n  Just an update to say that I\u0027m still working on this, sadly time has been a little scarce recently. I\u0027ve got the existing repository view rewritten using angularjs and freemarker in the \"groups\" mode. I\u0027m moving on to getting the filtering to happen. Once I\u0027ve done that I\u0027ll move on the \"flat\" mode and the filtering.\n\nCheers,\nAlex","id":"d8c7f176d3b6e4a816b40ef242944b446a199719"}},{"date":"2015-03-30T19:10:36Z","author":"alex","comment":{"text":"I\u0027m very sorry I\u0027ve not been able to look at this issue for such a long time; and it looks like that\u0027s going to be the case going forward.
