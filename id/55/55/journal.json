At the moment I can only reference a ticket, but not (additionally) a branch. E.g. I can only specify \"refs/for/{id}\", but not \"refs/for/{id}/{branch}\"\n\nI also could think of a \"cherry-pick-button\". It would try to cherry-pick a patchset (\u003d one or multiple commits) into another branch. An example:\n\n- master \u003d development branch\n- release-v1 \u003d stable branch v1\n1. Developer does a hotfix (patchset) in the development branch\n2. The owner of the repo (or whoever is responsible) can now verify it and merge it to the master branch\n3. With the new \"cherry-pick-button\" the owner can now cherry-pick the patchset into the release-v1 branch (or any other branch)\n 4. If it is not possible because of conflicts, I would like to be able to submit a rebased patchset for this branch (this is where you probably need \"refs/for/{id}/{branch}\")","id":"602c4593b2d0dc13f3f69fbe870009c0f8070b0b"},"fields":{"watchers":"+sengaya"}}]
