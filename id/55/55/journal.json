It would be really convenient if there was consideration for this use-case in Gitblit.\n\nOne possibility is to implement an automatic, semantic-versioning-based merge mechanism as a plugin.  This would essentially be what Stash offers [2].\n\nAnother approach would be to create a *hotfix* ticket which allowed you to merge the patchset of a ticket into multiple target branches.  The *hotfix* ticket branch would be required to have a merge base in the stable branch - i.e. you could not hotfix the *develop* branch.  This may require teaching Gitblit more about the git-flow workflow.\n\n- [1] http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model\n- [2] https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/STASH/Automatic+branch+merging","topic":"workflows","type":"Enhancement","responsible":"james","milestone":"v1.6.0","mergeTo":"develop","watchers":"+james","status":"New"}}]
