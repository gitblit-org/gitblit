I don\u0027t know if there are privacy concerns around this.\n\nSecond, we need to find a strategy to deal with invalid addresses on failed delivery. Should they be retried at all, if yes, how often and in what intervals? It\u0027s not very nice to keep hammering a SMTP server every two minutes. Some throttling would be nicer.\n\nI would suggest to re-queue the message with only the valid unset recipients. Then either discard the invalid recipient, assuming they will never go through, or re-queue a copy with the invalid recipients while at the same time keeping a counter of retries for this message.","type":"Bug","severity":"Minor","priority":"Normal","mergeTo":"develop","watchers":"+fzs","status":"New"}}]
