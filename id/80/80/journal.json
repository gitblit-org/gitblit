[{"date":"2014-05-16T14:19:02Z","author":"james","fields":{"title":"Re-evalulate Servlet3 and DI","body":"As part of the massive 1.4.0 refactor, I introduced [Dagger](http://square.github.io/dagger) for DI and updated to *Servlet3* which allowed me to eliminate almost everything in *web.xml*.\n\nThis worked great... until you ran Gitblit in a JEE container with CDI.  Gitblit would fail to load properly because the container\u0027s dependency injector was intercepting all `@Inject` references thus not allowing Dagger to do it\u0027s job.  This was bad and I couldn\u0027t figure out how to stop the container from *helping* so I rolled-back to Servlet 2.4 in 65d5bb3f1cbfb42be5a3c4aa077b7ab2504082af and eliminated all JSR-330 annotations but retained Dagger in a reduced capacity.\n\nI want to take another stab at this (Dagger pun intended).  I\u0027ve stumbled across [this short page](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/gjbnz.html) which may make Dagger DI using JSR-330 annotations work properly in a JEE container.  More details about *beans.xml* are available [here](http://www.seamframework.org/124139.lace).\n\nA switch to Guice is also a possibility, although I need to understand the limitations of Dagger (and the presumed benefits of Guice) before making that jump.","type":"Task","responsible":"james","mergeTo":"develop","watchers":"+james","status":"New"}},{"date":"2014-05-16T14:35:32Z","author":"james","fields":{"topic":"servlet3"},"patchset":{"number":1,"rev":1,"tip":"5e251e9d5c400722d664e7138875fba1bb2162b7","base":"5196d03ddf2a56048f33eabe4dc4bf055164ad81","insertions":651,"deletions":351,"commits":1,"added":0,"type":"Proposal"}}]
