We\u0027ll have to dress it up to give it some mass - having a lone delete button would look peculiar.  And now that I look at it, I like the tabbed-part but I never restructured the repo header.  Yuck, looks terrrible. Well another thing to put on the list, I suppose.  ;)","id":"12c9af00cc12d1f13e9df9002d0e6febd69ebad4"}}]
