We\u0027ll have to dress it up to give it some mass - having a lone delete button would look peculiar.  And now that I look at it, I like the tabbed-part but I never restructured the repo header.  Yuck, looks terrrible. Well another thing to put on the list, I suppose.  ;)","id":"12c9af00cc12d1f13e9df9002d0e6febd69ebad4"}},{"date":"2014-11-20T20:59:51Z","author":"fzs","comment":{"text":"As mentioned above, I did not want to load this off on you and I don\u0027t consider this urgent in any way.\nI\u0027m willing to try my hand at this myself.
