          !! IMPORTANT BUG FIX FOR PASSWORD HASH UPGRADE !!
          
          There is a severe bug in version 1.9.0, which can lock users out from their accounts.
          When updating from a previous version to 1.9.0, existing stored passwords are rehashed
          with a more secure password hash mechanism when a user first logs in after the update.
          This happens when the password hashing mechanism was left at default and not specifically
          set in the configuration. An error in the implementation will destroy the stored password
          instead and the user can no longer log in.

          Only certain circumstances will lead to this wrong behaviour. It will most likely
          affect users of the Gitblit Docker container. If you did not encounter any problems,
          update to 1.9.1 to be on the safe side. If you were hit by this bug, we are deeply sorry.
          There is no way to fix the affected accounts other than to set a new password.

          This is fixed in 1.9.1. Updates of existing installations should be made to 1.9.1, not 1.9.0.
          ''
    security: ~
    fixes:
      - Fixed broken password hash upgrade destroying existing stored passwords on update.
      - Fixed Linux service scripts to use `-cp` parameter instead of `-jar`.

    title: Gitblit 1.9.0 released
    id: 1.9.0
    date: 2020-02-01
    note: ''
          Gitblit uses Servlet 3.0 and thus drops support for Tomcat 6. Run on Tomcat 6 at your own risk. 

          With the update to Lucene 5.5.2 reindexing of the tickets is necessary. This is done automatically during the first server start after an upgrade. Depending on the amount of tickets you have, this could take a little while. The old index is kept, so that a downgrade is still possible without losing information. The old index can be deleted, when a downgrade is no longer required.

          The interface for the ITicketService changed. If you have your own derived implementation, rename `start` to `onStart`. (see commit-63dbdfda)

          To support Java 9+, Gitblit can no longer load JARs from the 'ext' folder by itself. In order to include the folder, it needs to be added to the classpath explicitly by changing the command line. Check the new start scripts to see the new required command line.

          The 1.9 minor version will be the last to support Java 7. From 1.10 on Gitblit will require Java 8.

          When the `realm.ldap.bindpattern` property is set, GitBlit will only bind as the user to LDAP, not to a manager account or anonymously.

          Older password storage mechanisms are deprecated, PBKDF2 is the new default. When you switch from plaintext to a hashed scheme, or from the older hashed to the new PBKDF2 scheme, the stored password of a user will be rehashed with the more secure mechanism when the user logs in.
          !! THIS IS BROKEN IN 1.9.0. DO NOT UPDATE TO 1.9.0. USE 1.9.1 INSTEAD !!

          !! IMPORTANT BUG FIX FOR EXTERNAL AUTHENTICATION (1.4.1) !!
          
          This is a MAJOR release (1.4.0).
          
          The entire core has been refactored to be more modular.  Authentication providers have all been refactored to be simpler.  Both of these were precursor requirements for landing the Tickets feature -- issue tracker & branch-based pull requests.
          
          Markup rendering has been improved and expanded to several additional formats.  A repository mirroring service  has been added to allow you to automatically track public repositories.  Commit pages now indicate diffstat information and many bug fixes and smaller features have been introduced.
          
          The groundwork has also been laid for SSH support which will be in the focal point for the next major release (ticket-6).
          
          Due to the enormity of these changes, please make a backup copy of users.conf before updating.''

        - RW+ (clone and push with ref creation, deletion, rewind)
        
      While not as sophisticated as Gitolite, this does give finer access controls.  These permissions fit in cleanly with the existing users.conf and users.properties files.  In Gitblit <= 1.1.0, all your existing user accounts have RW+ access.   If you are upgrading to 1.2.0, the RW+ access is *preserved* and you will have to lower/adjust accordingly.
      ''
    - ''Implemented *case-insensitive* regex repository permission matching (issue 332)

      This allows you to specify a permission like `RW:mygroup/.*` to grant push privileges to all repositories within the *mygroup* project/folder.''
    - Added DELETE, CREATE, and NON-FAST-FORWARD ref change logging
    - ''Added support for personal repositories.
      Personal repositories can be created by accounts with the *create* permission and are stored in *git.repositoriesFolder/~username*.  Each user with personal repositories will have a user page, something like the GitHub profile page.  Personal repositories have all the same features as common repositories, except personal repositories can be renamed by their owner.''
    - ''Added support for server-side forking of a repository to a personal repository (issue 433)
      In order to fork a repository, the user account must have the *fork* permission **and** the repository must *allow forks*.  The clone inherits the access list of its origin.  i.e. if Team A has clone access to the origin repository, then by default Team A also has clone access to the fork.  This is to facilitate collaboration.  The fork owner may change access to the fork and add/remove users/teams, etc as required <u>however</u> it should be noted that all personal forks will be enumerated in the fork network regardless of access view restrictions.  If you really must have an invisible fork, the clone it locally, create a new repository for your invisible fork, and push it back to Gitblit.''
    - Added optional *create-on-push* support
    - Added **experimental** JGit-based garbage collection service.  This service is disabled by default.
    - ''Added support for X509 client certificate authentication.  (issue 402)
      You can require all git servlet access be authenticated by a client certificate.  You may also specify the OID fingerprint to use for mapping a certificate to a username.  It should be noted that the user account MUST already exist in Gitblit for this authentication mechanism to work; this mechanism can not be used to automatically create user accounts from a certificate.''
    - Revised clean install certificate generation to create a Gitblit GO Certificate Authority certificate; an SSL certificate signed by the CA certificate; and to create distinct server key and server trust stores.  <u>The store files have been renamed!</u>
    - Added support for Gitblit GO to require usage of client certificates to access the entire server.
    - Added **Gitblit Certificate Authority**, an x509 PKI management tool for Gitblit GO to encourage use of x509 client certificate authentication.
    - Added web.shortCommitId setting to control length of shortened commit ids
    - Added alternate compressed download formats: tar.gz, tar.xz, tar.bzip2 (issue 470)
    - Added simple project pages.  A project is a subfolder off the *git.repositoriesFolder*.
    - Added support for X-Forwarded-Context for Apache subdomain proxy configurations (issue 431)
    - Delete branch feature (issue 417)
    - Added line links to blob view (issue 426)
    - Added HTML sendmail hook script and Gitblit.sendHtmlMail method
    - Added RedmineUserService
    - Support for committer verification.  Requires use of *--no-ff* when merging branches or pull requests.  See setup page for details.
    - Added Brazilian Portuguese translation

    changes:
    - Added server setting to specify keystore alias for ssl certificate (issue 394)
    - Added optional global and per-repository activity page commit contribution throttle to help tame *really* active repositories (issue 469)
    - Added support for symlinks in tree page and commit page (issue 467)
    - All access restricted servlets (e.g. DownloadZip, RSS, etc) will try to authenticate using X509 certificates, container principals, cookies, and BASIC headers, in that order.
    - Added *groovy* and *scala* to *web.prettyPrintExtensions*
    - Added short commit id column to log and history tables (issue 464)
    - Teams can now specify the *admin*, *create*, and *fork* roles to simplify user administration
    - Use https Gravatar urls to avoid browser complaints
    - Added frm to default pretty print extensions (issue 452)
    - Expose ReceivePack to Groovy push hooks (issue 421)
    - Redirect to summary page when refreshing the empty repository page on a repository that is not empty (issue 425)
    - Emit a warning in the log file if running on a Tomcat-based servlet container which is unfriendly to %2F forward-slash url encoding AND Gitblit is configured to mount parameters with %2F forward-slash url encoding (issue 422)
    - ''LDAP admin attribute setting is now consistent with LDAP teams setting and admin teams list.
      If *realm.ldap.maintainTeams==true* **AND** *realm.ldap.admins* is not empty, then User.canAdmin() is controlled by LDAP administrative team membership.  Otherwise, User.canAdmin() is controlled by Gitblit.''
    - Support servlet container authentication for existing UserModels (issue 364)

    title: Gitblit 1.1.0 Released
    id: 1.1.0
    date: 2012-08-25
    note: If you are updating from an earlier release AND you have indexed branches with the Lucene indexing feature, you need to be aware that this release will completely re-index your repositories.  Please be sure to provide ample heap resources as appropriate for your installation.

    fixes:
    - Bypass Wicket's inability to handle direct url addressing of a view-restricted, grouped repository for new, unauthenticated sessions (e.g. click link from email or rss feed without having an active Wicket session)
    - Fixed MailExecutor's failure to cope with mail server connection troubles resulting in 100% CPU usage
    - Fixed generated urls in Groovy *sendmail* hook script for grouped repositories
    - Fixed generated urls in RSS feeds for grouped repositories
    - Fixed nullpointer exception in git servlet security filter (issue 419)
    - Eliminated an unnecessary repository enumeration call on the root page which should result in faster page loads (issue 399)
    - Gitblit could not delete a Lucene index in a working copy on index upgrade
    - Do not index submodule links (issue 415)
    - Restore original user or team object on failure to update (issue 414)
    - Fixes to relative path determination in repository search algorithm for symlinks (issue 412)
    - Fix to GitServlet to allow pushing to symlinked repositories (issue 412)
    - Repository URL now uses `X-Forwarded-Proto` and `X-Forwarded-Port`, if available, for reverse proxy configurations (issue 411)
    - Output real RAW content, not simulated RAW content (issue 410)
    - Fixed Lucene charset encoding bug when reindexing a repository (issue 408)
    - Fixed search box linking to Lucene page for grouped repository on Tomcat (issue 407)
    - Fixed null pointer in LdapUserSerivce if account has a null email address (issue 406)
    - Really fixed failure to update a GO setting from the manager (issue 381)

    additions:
    - Identified repository list is now cached by default to reduce disk io and to improve performance (issue 399)
    - Preliminary bare repository submodule support
    - ''
      *git.submoduleUrlPatterns* is a space-delimited list of regular expressions for extracting a repository name from a submodule url.
      For example, `git.submoduleUrlPatterns = .*?://github.com/(.*)` would extract *gitblit/gitblit.git* from *git://github.git/gitblit/gitblit.git*
      **Note:** You may not need this control to work with submodules, but it is there if you do.
        - If there are no matches from *git.submoduleUrlPatterns* then the repository name is assumed to be whatever comes after the last `/` character *(e.g. gitblit.git)*
        - Gitblit will try to locate this repository relative to the current repository *(e.g. myfolder/myrepo.git, myfolder/mysubmodule.git)* and then at the root level *(mysubmodule.git)* if that fails.
        - Submodule references in a working copy will be properly identified as gitlinks, but Gitblit will not traverse into the working copy submodule repository.
      ''
    - ''
      Added a repository setting to control authorization as AUTHENTICATED or NAMED. (issue 413)

      NAMED is the original behavior for authorizing against a list of permitted users or permitted teams.
      AUTHENTICATED allows restricted access for any authenticated user.  This is a looser authorization control.
      ''
    - Added default authorization control setting (AUTHENTICATED or NAMED)
    - Added setting to control how deep Gitblit will recurse into *git.repositoriesFolder* looking for repositories (issue 399)
    - Added setting to specify regex exclusions for repositories (issue 399)
    - Blob page now supports displaying images (issue 302)
    - Non-image binary files can now be downloaded using the RAW link
    - Support StartTLS in LdapUserService (issue 418)
    - Added Korean translation

    changes:
    - Line breaks inserted for readability in raw Markdown content display in the event of a parsing/transformation error.  An error message is now displayed prepended to the raw content.
    - Improve UTF-8 reading for Markdown files
    - Updated Polish translation
    - Updated Japanese translation
    - Updated Spanish translation
    
    settings:
    - { name: git.cacheRepositoryList, defaultValue: 'true' }
    - { name: git.submoduleUrlPatterns, defaultValue: * }
    - { name: git.searchExclusions, defaultValue: * }
    - { name: git.searchRecursionDepth, defaultValue: -1 }

r13: {
    title: Gitblit 1.0.0 Released
    id: 1.0.0
    date: 2012-07-14

    fixes:
    - Fixed bug in Lucene search where old/stale blobs were never properly deleted during incremental updates.  This resulted in duplicate blob entries in the index.
    - Fixed intermittent bug in identifying line numbers in Lucene search (issue 401)
    - Adjust repository identification algorithm to handle the scenario where a repository name collides with a group/folder name (e.g. foo.git and foo/bar.git) (issue 400)
    - Fixed bug where a repository set as *authenticated push* did not have anonymous clone access (issue 392)
    - Fixed bug in Basic authentication if passwords had a colon
    - Fixed bug where the Gitblit Manager could not update a setting that was not referenced in reference.properties (issue 381)

    changes:
    - ''**Updated Lucene index version which will force a rebuild of ALL your Lucene indexes**
      Make sure to properly set *web.blobEncodings* before starting Gitblit if you are updating!  (issue 393)''
    - Changed default layout for web ui from Fixed-Width layout to Responsive layout (issue 397)
    - ''IUserService interface has changed to better accomodate custom authentication and/or custom authorization.
      The default `users.conf` now supports persisting display names and email addresses.''
    - Updated Japanese translation

    additions:
    - Added setting to allow specification of a robots.txt file (issue 395)
    - ''Added setting to control Responsive layout or Fixed-Width layout (issue 397)
      Responsive layout is now the default.  This layout gracefully scales the web ui from a desktop layout to a mobile layout by hiding page components.  It is easy to try, just resize your browser or point your Android/iOS device to the url of your Gitblit install.''
    - Added setting to control charsets for blob string decoding.  Default encodings are UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, and the server default charset. (issue 393)      
    - ''Exposed JGit internal configuration settings in gitblit.properties/web.xml (issue 389)
      Review your `gitblit.properties` or `web.xml` for detailed explanations of these settings.''
    - Added default access restriction.  Applies to new repositories and repositories that have not been configured with Gitblit. (issue 384)
    - Added Ivy 2.2.0 dependency which enables Groovy Grapes, a mechanism to resolve and retrieve library dependencies from a Maven 2 repository within a Groovy push hook script
    - ''Added setting to control Groovy Grape root folder (location where resolved dependencies are stored)
      [Grape](http://groovy.codehaus.org/Grape) allows you to add Maven dependencies to your pre-/post-receive hook script classpath.''
    - Added LDAP User Service with many new *realm.ldap* keys
    - ''Added support for custom repository properties for Groovy hooks
      Custom repository properties complement hook scripts by providing text field prompts in the web ui and the Gitblit Manager for the defined properties.  This allows your push hooks to be parameterized.''
    - Added script to facilitate proxy environment setup on Linux
    - Added Polish translation
    - Added Spanish translation

    changes:
    - Reject pushes to a repository with a working copy (i.e. non-bare repository) (issue-345)
    - Changed default web.datetimestampLongFormat from *EEEE, MMMM d, yyyy h:mm a z* to *EEEE, MMMM d, yyyy HH:mm Z* (issue 346)
    - Expanded commit age coloring from 2 days to 30 days (issue 353)

    additions:
    - ''Added optional Lucene branch indexing (issue 312)
      Repository branches may be optionally indexed by Lucene for improved searching.  To use this feature you must specify which branches to index within the *Edit Repository* page; _no repositories are automatically indexed_.  Gitblit will build or incrementally update enrolled repositories on a 2 minute cycle. (i.e you will have to wait 2-3 minutes after respecifying indexed branches or pushing new commits before Gitblit will build/update the repository Lucene index.)
      If a repository has Lucene-indexed branches the *search* form on the repository pages will redirect to the root-level Lucene search page and only the content of those branches can be searched.<br/>
      If the repository does not specify any indexed branches then repository commit-traversal search is used.

      **Note:** Initial indexing of an existing repository can be memory-exhaustive. Be sure to provide your Gitblit server adequate heap space to index your repositories (e.g. -Xmx1024M).<br/>
      See the [setup](setup.html) page for additional details.''
    - Allow specifying timezone to use for Gitblit which is independent of both the JVM and the system timezone (issue 350)
    - Added a built-in AJP connector for integrating Gitblit GO into an Apache mod_proxy setup (issue 355)
    - ''On the Repositories page show a bang *!* character in the color swatch of a repository with a working copy (issue 345)
      Push requests to these repositories will be rejected.''
    - On all non-bare Repository pages show *WORKING COPY* in the upper right corner (issue 345)
    - New setting to prevent display/serving non-bare repositories
    - Added *protect-refs.groovy*
    - Allow setting default branch (relinking HEAD) to a branch or a tag
    - Added Ubuntu service init script (issue 368)
    - Added partial Japanese translation

    additions:
    - ''Platform-independent, Groovy push hook script mechanism.
      Hook scripts can be set per-repository, per-team, or globally for all repositories.''
    - ''*sendmail.groovy* for optional email notifications on push.
      You must properly configure your SMTP server settings in `gitblit.properties` or `web.xml` to use *sendmail.groovy*.''
    - New global key for mailing lists.  This is used in conjunction with the *sendmail.groovy* hook script.  All repositories that use the *sendmail.groovy* script will include these addresses in the notification process.  Please see the Setup page for more details about configuring sendmail.
    - *com.gitblit.GitblitUserService*.  This is a wrapper object for the built-in user service implementations.  For those wanting to only implement custom authentication it is recommended to subclass GitblitUserService and override the appropriate methods.  Going forward, this will help insulate custom authentication from new IUserService API and/or changes in model classes.
    - ''New default user service implementation: *com.gitblit.ConfigUserService* (`users.conf`)
      This user service implementation allows for serialization and deserialization of more sophisticated Gitblit User objects without requiring the encoding trickery now present in FileUserService (users.properties).  This will open the door for more advanced Gitblit features.
      For those upgrading from an earlier Gitblit version, a `users.conf` file will automatically be created for you from your existing `users.properties` file on your first launch of Gitblit <u>however</u> you will have to manually set *realm.userService=users.conf* to switch to the new user service.
      The original `users.properties` file and the corresponding implementation are **deprecated**.''
    - Teams for specifying user-repository access in bulk.  Teams may also specify mailing lists addresses and pre- & post- receive hook scripts.
    - Gravatar integration
    - Activity page for aggregated repository activity.  This is a timeline of commit activity over the last N days for one or more repositories.
    - *Filters* menu for the Repositories page and Activity page.  You can filter by federation set, team, and simple custom regular expressions.  Custom expressions can be stored in `gitblit.properties` or `web.xml` or directly defined in your url (issue 323)
    - Flash-based 1-step *copy to clipboard* of the primary repository url based on Clippy
    - JavaScript-based 3-step (click, ctrl+c, enter) *copy to clipboard* of the primary repository url in the event that you do not want to use Flash on your installation
    - Empty repositories now link to an *empty repository* page which gives some direction to the user for the next step in using Gitblit.  This page displays the primary push/clone url of the repository and gives sample syntax for the git command-line client. (issue 327)
    - Repositories with a *gh-pages* branch will now have a *pages* link which will serve the content of this branch.  All resource requests are against the repository, Gitblit does not checkout/export this branch to a temporary filesystem.  Jekyll templating is not supported.
    - Gitblit Express bundle to get started running Gitblit on RedHat OpenShift cloud <span class="label label-warning">BETA</span>

    changes:
    - Dropped display of trailing .git from repository names
    - ''Gitblit GO is now monolithic like the WAR build. (issue 326)
      This change helps adoption of GO in environments without an internet connection or with a restricted connection.''
    - Unit testing framework has been migrated to JUnit4 syntax and the test suite has been redesigned to run all unit tests, including rpc, federation, and git push/clone tests

    fixes:
    - ''federation protocol timestamps.  dates are now serialized to the [iso8601](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) standard.

    - RSS feeds are now properly encoded to UTF-8
    - RSS feeds now properly generate parameterized links if *web.mountParameters=false*
    - Null pointer exception if did not set federation strategy (issue 316)
    - Gitblit GO allows SSL renegotiation if running on Java 1.6.0_22 or later
        
    changes:
    - updated ui with Twitter Bootstrap CSS toolkit
    - repositories list performance by caching repository sizes (issue 323)
    - summary page performance by caching metric calculations (issue 321)
    
    additions:
    - authenticated JSON RPC mechanism
    - Gitblit API RSS/JSON RPC library
    - Gitblit Manager (Java/Swing Application) for remote administration of a Gitblit server.
    - per-repository setting to skip size calculation (faster repositories page loading)
    - per-repository setting to skip summary metrics calculation (faster summary page loading)
    - IUserService.setup(IStoredSettings) for custom user service implementations
    - setting to control Gitblit GO context path for proxy setups
    - *combined-md5* password storage option which stores the hash of username+password as the password
    - repository owners are automatically granted access for git, feeds, and zip downloads without explicitly selecting them
    - RSS feeds now include regex substitutions on commit messages for bug trackers, etc

# 0.6.0

r4: {
    title: Gitblit 0.6.0 Released
    id: 0.6.0
    date: 2011-09-27

    fixes:
    - syndication urls for WAR deployments
    - authentication for zip downloads

    additions:
    - federation feature to allow gitblit instances (or gitblit federation clients) to pull repositories and, optionally, settings and accounts from other gitblit instances.  This is something like [svn-sync](http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.ref.svnsync.html) for gitblit.
    - user role *#notfederated* to prevent a user account from being pulled by a federated Gitblit instance

    settings:
    - { name: federation.name, defaultValue: }
    - { name: federation.passphrase, defaultValue: }
    - { name: federation.allowProposals, defaultValue: 'false' }
    - { name: federation.proposalsFolder, defaultValue: proposals }
    - { name: federation.defaultFrequency, defaultValue: 60 mins }
    - { name: federation.sets, defaultValue: }
    - { name: "mail.*", defaultValue: }

r3: {
    title: Gitblit 0.5.2 Released
    id: 0.5.2
    date: 2011-07-27

    fixes:
    - active repositories with a HEAD that pointed to an empty branch caused internal errors (issue 310)
    - bare-cloned repositories were listed as (empty) and were not clickable (issue 309)
    - default port for Gitblit GO is now 8443 to be more linux/os x friendly (issue 308)
    - repositories can now be reliably deleted and renamed (issue 306)
    - always show root repository group first, i.e. do not sort root group with other groups
    - tone-down repository group header color
    
    additions:
    - users can now change their passwords (issue 297)
    - optionally display repository on-disk size on repositories page
    - forward-slashes ('/', %2F) can be encoded using a custom character to workaround some servlet container default security measures for proxy servers
    
    settings:
    - { name: web.showRepositorySizes, defaultValue: 'true' }
    - { name: web.forwardSlashCharacter, defaultValue: / }
